# Daraz-like E-commerce Website

This project is a frontend implementation of an e-commerce website inspired by Daraz, using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Header with logo, search bar, login/signup, language selection, and cart
- Categories dropdown menu
- Banner showcasing key features (safe payments, nationwide delivery, etc.)
- Product display section with ratings and prices
- Footer with multiple sections including customer care, company information, international branches, payment methods, and social media links

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Font Awesome (for icons)

## Structure

The website consists of the following main sections:

1. Header
2. Features bar
3. Banner
4. Shopping section (product display)
5. Footer

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser

Note: This project uses Tailwind CSS and Font Awesome via CDN, so an internet connection is required for proper styling and icons.

## Customization

- To change the logo, replace the image in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag in the header section
- To modify colors, adjust the Tailwind CSS classes or add custom CSS
- To add or remove products, duplicate or delete the `<div class="shop-items">` elements in the shopping section

## Future Improvements

- Implement backend functionality for dynamic content
- Add product detail pages
- Implement a working search feature
- Create a functional shopping cart

## Credits

This project is for educational purposes and is inspired by the Daraz e-commerce platform. All product images and logos are placeholders and should be replaced with your own content in a real application.
